            Hi! My name is Charlie Chan, a passionate individual on a
            transformative journey from my previous role as a seasoned Senior
            Quotation Analyst to my current pursuit as a Front-End Web, Software,
            JavaScript, and React Developer.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Throughout my career, I honed my skills in cost analysis, sales, and
            technical aspects of circuit board industry, establishing myself as a
            proficient problem solver and collaborator. I thrived in roles where I
            crafted solutions, negotiated pricing agreements, and fostered
            enduring relationships with clients and colleagues. My experience
            equipped me with valuable qualities like attention to detail,
            adaptability, and a penchant for continuous learning.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            My fascination with technology and its ever-evolving landscape led me
            to embark on a new adventure in the world of web development. Eager to
            embrace this exciting challenge, I dived headfirst into learning the
            intricacies of web technologies. I embarked on a journey of discovery,
            diving into JavaScript and React-two powerful tools
            that drive modern, dynamic web applications.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            As I tread further along this path, I've found immense joy in crafting 
            elegant and interactive web solutions, with growing awareness of 
            performance and user experience considerations. I'm familiar with 
            optimization techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, and 
            memoization, and I plan to actively apply these practices in upcoming 
            projects to improve efficiency, scalability, and overall usability.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Beyond the code, I'm an advocate for collaboration, teamwork, and
            continuous improvement. I believe in the transformative potential of
            technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            I'm a software developer proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
            TypeScript, with aspirations to become a full-stack developer. I have 
            hands-on experience building structured, type-safe applications using 
            modern React patterns, and I continue expanding my backend knowledge 
            with Node.js, Express.js, SQL, GraphQL, OAuth, and Python. I'm committed 
            to writing clean, maintainable code while continuously improving 
            performance, scalability, and overall application quality.
          </p>

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            When I'm not coding or exploring the latest web trends, you can find
            me enjoying the simple pleasures of life, be it an exploratory hiking
            adventure, or outdoor activities like biking, playing tennis or golf.

            innovation and a commitment to creating meaningful digital
            experiences. Join me as I continue to evolve, learn, and contribute to
