## About Me

I am a Web Developer with a passion for creating beautiful and engaging web experiences. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I'm on a transformative journey to become a full-stack developer. In line with my goals, I'm also exploring Python, SQL, Node.js and Ruby on Rails but may change depending on the technologies used in the company I will work with.

## Technologies

Every project is constructed utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and a selection of libraries.
